# Atliq Hotels – Hospitality Data Analytics Project (Power BI Dashboard)

This project is an introduction to data analytics for the hospitality domain. Using hotel booking datasets, I created a **Power BI dashboard** to explore the data, visualize trends, and understand hotel operations. The project helped me practice data cleaning, modelling, KPI creation, and interactive reporting.

## Project Overview

The goal of the project was to gain hands-on experience in transforming raw data into insights. I worked with booking and hotel data to build a dashboard that shows key metrics like revenue trends, room occupancy, and booking patterns.

## My Role

As a fresher learning data analytics, I focused on:  
1. Cleaning and preparing raw datasets for analysis.  
2. Structuring data in a way that is easy to query and visualize.  
3. Creating basic KPIs to measure hotel performance.  
4. Building a Power BI dashboard with charts and filters to explore the data.

## What I Did

- **Data Preparation**  
  - Loaded datasets (Hotels, Rooms, Bookings, Dates) using Power Query.  
  - Corrected data types, merged columns, and created calculated metrics like revenue and occupancy.  

- **Data Modelling**  
  - Connected dimension tables (Hotels, Rooms, Dates) with booking data.  
  - Practiced building a simple star schema for efficient dashboard design.  

- **KPI Creation**  
  - Defined basic KPIs including Revenue, Occupancy Rate, Cancellation Rate, and Booking Counts.  
  - Applied DAX measures to calculate metrics in Power BI.  

- **Dashboard Development**  
  - Designed interactive visuals and filters to explore hotel performance.  
  - Created reports on Revenue Trends, Booking Patterns, and Room Utilisation.  

- **Insights Learned**  
  - Observed patterns like seasonal changes in bookings and occupancy.  
  - Practiced translating data observations into simple insights for decision-making.
